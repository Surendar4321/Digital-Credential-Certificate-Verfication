# Tamper-Proof Digital Credential Verification Using Blockchain and Capsule Siamese Networks

## 📜 Overview

This project aims to modernize and secure digital credential management by leveraging Blockchain Technology, Capsule Siamese Networks, and One-Time Symmetric Key Encryption. It addresses the growing concerns around certificate forgery and inefficient manual verification processes by offering a robust, scalable, and tamper-proof solution for issuing and verifying educational certificates.

## 🧠 Key Features

🔒 Tamper-proof storage using Blockchain with cryptographic hash functions

🤖 Forgery detection via Capsule Siamese Neural Networks

🗝️ Secure data transmission using One-Time Symmetric Key encryption

🌐 Role-based web interface for Issuers, Holders, and Verifiers

⚠️ Real-time fraud alerts and tampering notifications

🔄 Blockchain immutability with decentralized trust

📲 Certificate locker web app for secure access and sharing

🧪 Rigorous testing including black-box and white-box methodologies
